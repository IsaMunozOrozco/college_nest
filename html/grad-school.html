        <p>A doctorate of philosophy, most commonly known as a PhD, is considered the highest-level of academic qualifications. It is a research-focused degree that takes 4+ years to complete. All PhD programs lead to a dissertation, which is a longer version of a master's thesis or capstone project. </p>
        <p>A typical PhD consists of required courses and milestones you have to meet to complete the degree. However, there is a lot of room for independence - in the way you structure your overall experience. This can be a pro or a con. Besides being a student, oftentimes, you have to balance multiple roles and responsibilities such as:</p>
        <li>Coursework</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Teaching</li>
        <li>Applying to Funding such as Grants</li>
        <li>Academic Writing</li>
        <li>Mentoring</li>
        <li>Project Management (often working on multiple projects)</li>
        <li>Scientific Communication (e.g., presenting research at a conference, publishing scientific articles, etc.)</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>Lots of Problem Solving and Troubleshooting</li>
        <p>...among others not mentioned, all on top of just being a whole human who is a family member, friend, neighbor, etc.</p>
