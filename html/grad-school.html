        <p>A doctorate of philosophy, most commonly known as a PhD, is considered the highest-level of academic qualifications (but it is definitely not the end-all-be-all). It is a research-focused degree that takes 4+ years to complete. All PhD programs lead to a dissertation, which is a longer version of a master's thesis or capstone project. </p>
        <p>A typical PhD consists of required courses and milestones you have to meet to complete the degree. However, there is a lot of room for independence - in the way you structure your overall experience. This can be a pro or a con. Besides being a student, oftentimes, you have to balance multiple roles and responsibilities such as:</p>
        <li>Coursework</li>
        <li>Research</li>
        <li>Teaching</li>
        <li>Applying to Funding such as Grants</li>
        <li>Academic Writing</li>
        <li>Mentoring</li>
        <li>Project Management (often working on multiple projects)</li>
        <li>Scientific Communication (e.g., presenting research at a conference, publishing scientific articles, etc.)</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>lots of problem solving and troubleshooting</li>
        <br><p>...among others not mentioned, all on top of just being a whole human.</p>
        <p>Find specific resources below. Since research is a huge part of a PhD, we decided not to add the sub-section on this page as <i>Research</i> has it's own tab. Please visit the <i>Research</i> tab for related resources.</p>

                    <h3>Mentor-Mentee Relationship</h3>
                    <p>Probably the most important relationship during your PhD is the one with your mentor. Like any relationship, it is a two-way street, so what you put into the relationship is what you get out of it.</p>
