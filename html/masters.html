            <p>A master's degree is a type of graduate degree that is typically pursued after the completion of undergraduate studies (bachelor's degree). A master's takes about 1-3 years to complete and focuses on gaining advanced knowledge on a specific field. Depending on your career goals, getting a master's degree may be a requirement, a benefit for an increase in pay, or an opportunity to get research experience.</p>
            <p>One must note that getting funding for a master's degree can be a challenge. So, most either pay out-of-pocket or take out loans. In some cases, employers help pay for your master's.</p>
            <br><h3>APPLICATION PREREQUISITES</h3>
            <p>Every program will have a slightly different application process, but the common requirements for applying to a master's are:</p>
