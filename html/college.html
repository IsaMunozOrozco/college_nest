            <br><p>Navigating the first steps in higher education (community college and 4-year universities) is generally straight-forward, as it can be broken into clear steps - such as choosing a major, completing required courses, and meeting course credits for graduation. Most programs will even provide you with a roadmap or degree timeline - you can also meet regularly with an academic advisor for recommended courses and to make sure you are on track. However, the intricacies of each "step" can sometimes be nuanced. </p><br>
            <h3>Where to start?</h3>
            <p>Are you close to graduating from high school and are still debating whether to start at a community college or 4-year institution? As a preface, there is no right answer, it comes down to what you want and what you want to get out of it. However, here are some things to keep in mind when deciding.</p>
            <p>Start with the end in mind...a degree is not the end-all-be-all, it's a training phase in the looong professional journey. So ask yourself what you want to gain? Learn? Sometimes it's helpful to know what your end-goal is and work out the steps backwards. For instance, if I know I want to be a medical doctor, then it would be wise to think about majoring in biological, physical, psychological, or health sciences. </p>
            <p>If you have no idea "what you want to be when you grow up," then you can apply as <i>undecided</i> and figure out your interest as you go. Community College can be a great option if you need time to figure out what you want to do, but it's an overall good starting point in general because it tends to be more affordable, have more accessible admissions process, and can provide a chance to improve your GPA, particularly if your high school performance was not as strong as you desired.</p>
            <p>Universities tend to be approximately 4-6 years instiutions that culminate into a Bachelor's degree, with options such as small liberal arts colleges to Ivy League institutions. They offer a broader range of degrees and extracurricular activities. However, attendance can be costly and admissions can be highly selective. </p>
