            <br><p>Navigating the first steps in higher education (community college and 4-year universities) is generally straight-forward, as it can be broken into clear steps - such as choosing a major, completing required courses, and meeting course credits for graduation. Most programs will even provide you with a roadmap or degree timeline - you can also meet regularly with an academic advisor for recommended courses and to make sure you are on track. However, the intricacies of each "step" can sometimes be nuanced. </p><br>
